## Future Work

- **Mega Brainfuck**  
  Create a Brainfuck extension  to natively handle socket programming and possibly even multithreading.  
  *Inspiration: [R. Singh's Brainfuck++](https://github.com/Gr3atWh173/brainfuckplusplus)*  

- **Multi-line Inputs**  
  Enhance the interpreter to allow for multi-line terminal input.
